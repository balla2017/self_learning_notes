Mobile
gives you code-level visibility into networks, third-party services, crash diagnostics, HTTP errors, and deployment trends for your native mobile apps

*APM(Application Performance Monitoring):
gives you visibility into how your backend application is performing with detailed, real-time performance metrics down to specific lines of code
help you refactor
APM agent sends performance data to NR per minute
Dashboard show respond time, throughput, error rate.
left columns:
transaction, error analysis, databases?, external services, distributed tracing(trace machines, analyze the impact of each component)
top rows:
services maps show the relation and dependencies.
customize data:
can query and visualize your custom data to see patterns and performance trends
can use health maps to monitor the health of your applications and hosts using APM and infrausture.

*Browser:
gives you real user experience data and full code visibility for your front-end web applications
Aim:
-Real user monitor enables to understand and improve end-user experience
-Use data collected by NR Browser to improve website performance
-work with other NR products


Insights
use to analyze your data from all other products by creating queries to answer questions about application performance and customers experience

Synthetics
make sure your website is up 
make sure your critical services and customer-facing transactions are working properly
simulate user behavior to validate performance of your application

*Infrausture(let you look at your host resource usage-locally or in the cloud)
can help keep your cloud costs down by making it easier to identify opportunities to right size instances, fine tune databases, modify your storage usage, better configure load balancers and re-architect your applications.
gives you real-time health metrics for your hosts correlated to change events and Inventory-wide visibility for on-premise, hybrid, cloud, and container environments
CPU, memory used, load average
top:
inventory: make sure your hosts are running the correct packages.
events: what happen before/after a problem occurred
integrations:
on cloud & host(redis, mySQL, kafka, rabbitMQ, kubernates)
install cloudn : connect new relic account and cloud account
